Currently a reasonable mapping process on LiteMap is possible in case there is a previously existing well organised offline synthesis of a conversation or topic, so that LiteMap adds just the digitizing aspect to it, and the mapping process is carried out by one person to avoid possible access and edit conflicts. 

In order to have the best quality and well organised maps, quite a lot of preparatory work needs to be done on a topic or conversation before it can be mapped. 

The mapper needs to have extensive understanding of how LiteMap works technically and structurally, which can also take quite some time. Argument process is not native to most people and does not necessarily accommodate the variety of conversation structures emerging in a collaborative group.

It is hard to use LiteMap at its current state for mapping collaboratively because of the complex user interface and restricted data edit access, as well as the time delay it takes to see others’ changes.

It is nearly not possible to use LiteMap in a live documentation process. The situation has improved with the node Quick Add features, but the brainstorming speed in a live session is too high to enable capturing all the ideas effectively. Also in the case of internet connectivity issues one risks losing valuable information.

Currently it is nearly not possible to engage normal (not tech-savvy) users in the mapping or even viewing process. On one hand it may be caused by the nature of OuiShare community, characterized by high level of focused commitment in pre-defined projects either  in- or outside the community (or both), where the global network and its knowledge base serves as a pool of resources of immediate interest, necessity, availability and usability. Additionally the state of the map currently requires specific attention and commitment at the entry level which is not something that the community members typically take time for: a digital tool is preferably seen as means to an end, not a focal point in itself. 

The biggest challenge for LiteMap is to become attractive enough to naturally call for user engagement. The aspects of general aesthetics, overall visuals, primary engagement patterns and usability need to be taken care of. It would be good to lower the overall barrier of entry and work on tutorials, keeping in mind the speed and ease of finding options and answers, so that the user can spend the maximum available time on working with the actual data.

Nevertheless we see LiteMap as a tool of great potential, especially considering the presence of the entire Catalyst toolset and its interoperability. In addition to the collaborative mode, LiteMap has possibilities for extensive analytics, as well as for displaying and arranging data in different ways, which could be used for a variety of purposes like interactive presentations or as collaboratively created illustration material.
