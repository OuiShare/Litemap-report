We launched the Litemap-OuiShare collaboration at the end of January with a digicall between the project leaders of both sides. An initial list of bugs and requests was made from OuiShare perspective, after which Litemap team proceeded to implement some changes on the tool, we created OuiShare group and started the first maps. 

At the beginning of March, a status report was exchanged, admitting the changes in OuiShare workflow, and the continued difficulties with mapping user experience. In mid-March OuiShare Fest team organised the tweet chat on collaborative economy that gave input to Map 3. 

By the end of April the Litemap team had implemented the ability to change node types, full window map view options, a hideable sidebar for displaying node information, and simplified the creation of connections between nodes.

We used LiteMap with selected community discussions in OuiShare Summit at the end of June, and in mid-July the project leader went to meet LiteMap team in the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK.
