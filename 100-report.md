The test period lasted eventually from February to the beginning of August 2015, during which 7 extensive maps were created based on data from different online and offline sources. Most Litemap instances were created by a single person, one map was created by a small group of people. The resources contain conversations and direct information from groups of different sizes (10-60 people), as well as documents, books or parts of common knowledge.

Subsequently we will give a summary of the testing process, and an overview of use cases based on different mapping and data collecting methods, pointing out related issues and observations. A following “Maps” appendix will list all the created maps with screenshots, as well as their source materials where available.
