### Improve user experience and design

The greatest difficulty in using LiteMap, mentioned by each participant, is the complexity of the user interface and design in general. There were some improvements made during testing as for simplifying adding and connecting the nodes, as well as the mouse-over titles. However when arriving at a map, the node and relationship texts are not in immediately readable size. When zooming in to readable size, one loses overview of the entire map.

As a mapper, it is hard to navigate and understand what one can and is supposed to do. There are too many options that are not intuitively understandable. The live editing experience is lacking the instantaneity of familiar collaboration tools like Google Drive. Due to restricted node access management (in more detail below) it is not currently possible to use it for mapping with a group of people. It is hard to hit the tiny icons on each node that enable interactions with the content. It is not possible to change the type of a node after it’s linked to another. 

### Add flexibility to the access controls system

In a collaborative process all nodes and connections need to be editable by other group members or at least some of them. Group participants are often volunteers who pass by, contribute a little and move on, while their contributions need to be organised or changed later by others.  Currently it is not possible to edit any other nodes or relationships than one’s own.

For example Metamaps uses access control by 3 map and/or node types: Private - Public - Commons.

It would also be great to be able to share access and edit rights by group members. Considering that full wiki-like approaches often lead to spam issues, it would be good for communities to be able to restrict the edit access to group rather than leave it open to full public. In case of private or closed maps, at least group admins should have the ability to edit data on the map.

The viewing rights should also be reconsidered. There are community conversations that are held in circles within the group with no immediate public access. Some data may be sensitive at a time, but become public later. Sometimes people are not comfortable expressing themselves even in closed group space, or consider the information not relevant, which could explain 66% of OuiShare Slack posts being private messages rather than posts on a stream accessible by the whole community.

### Rethink the focus

LiteMap could have a lot of added value as a tool for simple mind-mapping, creating collaborative graph-based illustration materials for presentations or other online or offline displays. This might encourage its use by wider public not directly focused on argument mapping, while the added content would be available to harvest for using in LiteMap debates and other Catalyst tools if suitable. 

Currently there seem to be two main goals - mapping a conversation, or having a debate - it can be confusing with both goals being visible.
