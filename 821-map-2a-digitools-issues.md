title: Map 2a. Digital tools issues
permalink: /appendix/map-2a/
---

[Digital tools issues](https://litemap.net/map.php?id=78194135420380372001425929091) map is based on overview mindmaps and reflections made about the digital tools used within OuiShare community. The source mindmap (which in turn is a visualisation of a Trello board) lists used tools by tentative subcategories, with some tools named under several categories. 

The same source material helped produce another submap describing user access management issues related to the use and need of such an amount of working tools (see map 2b).
