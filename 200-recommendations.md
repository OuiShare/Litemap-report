title: 2. Recap - list of recommendations

Finally we will give an overview of the requested changes, features, bugs and ideas for future that came up during the testing process and conversations between team members. 

As some of these are technically complex, it was clearly not possible to implement all the ideas within the testing period and with resources available. However it is worth considering a follow-up project to continue the development of the tool and its features.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Status</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Structure</td>
<td>
More flexibility on node levels (ability to add arguments on different levels of mapping, both on issue and idea level)</td>
<td>
Added possibility to connect ideas to ideas. 
Feedback from LiteMap team:
“The structure is built on argumentation theory, so it’s rigid. The structure guides through the problem and to thinking about the solutions.”</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
UX/Design</td>
<td>
Little arrow for additional options is uncomfortable, the menu could open by clicking on or moving over the argument rectangle</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
Node</td>
<td>
Adding nodes through several popups is confusing. All such content should open in CSS layers in the same window</td>
<td>
Partly implemented with Quick Add feature</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
Map</td>
<td>
When scaling out the map, arguments become quickly unreadable. Node texts should be at least partly readable from any point of zoom, without any interaction required.</td>
<td>
Added mouse-over fields that repeat node titles but still require user interaction</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
Node</td>
<td>
Need ability to multi-select a group of arguments to move several at once (currently by one)</td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr><td>
Node</td>
<td>
Need ability to change the node type (e.g. from issue to idea to argument)</td>
<td>
Added, node changeable between all types when unconnected. Also added new type “comment”</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
Map</td>
<td>
Limited map view (map in a box) might be okay for embedding, but is constraining in editing. Show full screen or bigger map</td>
<td>
Added buttons to hide/unhide page top and sidebar</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
UX/Design</td>
<td>
Redesign Map view to be full screen by default, with not-map-related information being more discrete (E.g. <a href="http://metamaps.cc/maps/884">see Metamaps design</a></td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td>

It is not clear where the canvas ends and what is included in print preview</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>

Print preview</td>
<td>
Improve readability of nodes (design and/or text size) in print preview</td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr><td>
Bug</td>
<td>
It is not always clear which node is selected, often it moves several nodes even while only one is selected</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>

Map</td>
<td>
Arranging nodes is not very intuitive. It could have a feature of auto-self-arranging, or a button for optimal arrangement around clusters </td>
<td>
Feedback from LiteMap team: “Most users don’t want it actually because they’re meticulous about arranging it on their own. There are 2 auto-arrange preview options: network and tree. (Under Map Topic → Explore items)” </td>

</tr>
<tr><td>
Node</td>
<td>
Enable adding nodes by simply clicking on the map</td>
<td>
Quick Add options implemented, it is possible to add nodes with a click. The option is also available in sidebar menu.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td>
Enable creating relationships more easily (currently choosing from the menu opened by clicking on the arrow in the corner of the node)</td>
<td>
It is now possible to create relationships with a right click and drag.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
	</td>
<td>
Use a system like GitHub issues to enable filing tech/design issues and feature requests</td>
<td>
Feedback from LiteMap team: “We are thinking about a reporting system within LiteMaps.”</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>
	</td>
<td>
When opening a linked map from a map, open it in a new browser  tab or regular window, instead of a popup window
</td>
<td></td>


</tr>
<tr><td>
</td>
<td>
In map sidebar search list view, add ability to view the node content beyond headline before adding on the map, e.g. by opening a layer or node view when clicking on the title</td>
<td></td>


</tr>
<tr><td>
Bug</td>
<td>
Map created as private and later changed to Public is not showing up in the group where it was created. (<a href="https://litemap.net/map.php?id=822351732270106009001432920111">See this map</a>)</td>
<td></td>


</tr>
<tr><td>
Idea</td>
<td>
Enable relocating nodes in Linear view by drag and drop (like in mindmaps)</td>
<td></td>


</tr>
<tr><td>
Idea</td>
<td>
When harvesting from social networks, automatically link nodes to their authors’ profile in respective network, and enable user activity analysis based on this</td>
<td></td>


</tr>
<tr>
<td>
	</td>
<td>
Saving and scaling items vectorially rather than as a rasterized image would add a lot to readability</td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr><td>
Print preview</td>
<td>
Enable vectorial output (print or download map as PDF file or SVG image)</td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr><td>
Idea</td>
<td>
Add interactive presentation effects like in Prezi: e.g. ability to zoom in to node groups, create grouped “views” and their sequences</td>
<td></td>




</tr>
<tr><td></td>
<td>
Enable group admins to have edit access to all nodes and relationships on a map</td>
<td></td>
