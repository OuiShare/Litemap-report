At the very end of the testing period we thought to create and send out a questionnaire in order to gather data on understanding the viewer experience. However the previous experiments revealed the weaknesses of the user rights system in collaboration, and continued difficulties of engagement, which discouraged us from introducing a questionnaire that late in the process.Â 

Nevertheless a questionnaire assessing user engagement and understanding of the tool is something definitely worth working on. It might be necessary to clearly separate the roles of a mapper (community manager) and viewer in the questionnaire.

It would be also good to think of small incentives or a reward mechanism for those engaging with the maps as viewers, because the complexity of the tool, even with possibly reworked UX and design, requires significant time to learn and understand that most community members are not available for.
