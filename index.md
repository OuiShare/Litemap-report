## About the project

In the framework of EU CATALYST project, we’ve been exploring a Collective Intelligence tool called Litemap from the perspective of OuiShare community. 

[Litemap](https://litemap.net/) is an online tool created for mapping issues and debates. It allows classifying conversations into issues, ideas, and pro/con arguments.

This website holds an interactive copy of the documentation and report of the OuiShare - LiteMap project.
