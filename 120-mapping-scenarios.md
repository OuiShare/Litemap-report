### One mapper harvesting a debate or conversation happening in multiple offline, online, closed and open spaces

This method was used in case of Map 1 (E-mail management solutions), Map 2A and 2B (Issues around usage of digital tools).

Creating these maps took place at the beginning of the testing when adding a node was only available through a system of several layers of popup windows with several fields that needed to be filled each time. As the data often needed to be checked and copied from another document or program, it was easy to get lost between the windows during the copy-paste process. 

In immediate feedback we suggested simplifying the node add process, and replacing the pop-ups with CSS layers which was partly implemented by the end of the testing period.

At the beginning it was hard to understand the conversation structure expected by LiteMap (division of Issues, Ideas, and polarized Pro/Con arguments) and fit conversations into these. The sources of maps 2A and 2B were simple text- or mindmap-based overviews of all digital tools our community uses, and categorized issues and bottlenecks one should consider within such a context. It felt artificial to fit a category tree into a debate-like structure. However the ability to create additional relationships between issues and issue groups, and to see their visualisations in alternative map views adds better value to the general overview than a simple mindmap depiction.

As a result from OuiShare feedback to the first maps, the strict structure was somewhat relaxed by enabling adding several levels of Issues. Later it became also possible to add simple comments, non-polarized arguments, and to change the category of a node.

### One mapper harvesting a conversation on the public web

According to the proposal, this was the principal planned method of work. The method was used fully in the case of Map 3 where highlights from a tweet chat were harvested with the help of a Storify collection.

The bookmarklet worked well, although it had problems interacting with and placing bookmarks correctly in Twitter posts, which is probably due to Twitter API.

It was much easier putting nodes on the map while the conversation was already gathered mostly in one place (Storify). It would have been great to be able to track the authors of tweets in some way and draw LiteMap analytics based on that information, but such a feature may be complicated to develop.

### Mapping an offline community conversation

This method was used with maps 4 and 5\. Conversations took place during OuiShare Summit #6 at the end of June 2015 in Italy, where over 50 Connectors and Members gathered for the semi-annual event -- 3 days of working and discussions. Two conversations were chosen and documented for the mapping.

As wifi was scarce and slow during the event, most documentation was created offline (with offline digital tools or as notes or mindmaps on paper), and LiteMap instances were created later.

First, we had a small 1-hour session with a group of 8 people (OuiCare, Map 4). During the session a paper mindmap was created by the session documentors that was then converted to a digital offline mindmap by session leader and testing leader. Later the session points were synthesized to fit LiteMap structure.

Secondly, we had a 2-3 hours long session with a code name OuiShare Democracy (Map 5) that included almost all 50+ participants broken into groups, with conclusions delivered at the end of the day. The wrap-up session was concurrently added on a mindmap that was shared with the community but received no immediate feedback. Later the repeating issues and questions were synthesized and added on LiteMap which was then shared in the community but has not gained any specific feedback yet.

For both maps we had planned to complete the LiteMap instances based on offline documentation and with participation of other people from the original discussions, thus testing group features. However the interested people were not available after the Summit, and the eventual group mapping attempt was not as successful as we hoped, as explained in the next point.

### Mapping with a group of people

In order to test out the collaboration features and statistics LiteMap offers, we invited available and interested Connectors to take part in the process, giving them beforehand some explanations and links to already created maps, and proposing times for a 2-hour hangout to work on a map together. A group of three participants was interested and available to meet via an online hangout to address the task.

We had planned to continue collaborative mapping based on the Summit conversation maps, as this was something all of us were aware of and interested in. However as the hangout started with many questions and comments about LiteMap itself, it was spontaneously proposed to create a “LiteMap feedback” map (Map 6), reflecting the user experience process itself. In the end it took us all of the allocated time (2+ hours) to create nodes on the feedback map.

During the process, we realised that before a group mapping we need to synchronise our understanding on what is available, to define common symbols. It is complicated and time-consuming because everybody thinks differently. It is also necessary to have very good technical knowledge on the tool before a mapping session, currently the adoption threshold is quite high. (Unfortunately people were not able to spend additional time on learning to use the tool, because everyone is constantly overloaded, a typical OuiShare issue that is also reflected on the community discussion maps.)

We also missed searchable text-based documentation with screenshots on how to use some features. Currently all tutorials are available in video format, but it is not possible to quickly search for a specific answer.

As this happened at the end of the testing period, we were happy to use the quick-add features on LiteMap (adding nodes with a click on the map), and enjoyed the improved simplicity of creating relationships between nodes (right click and drag).
