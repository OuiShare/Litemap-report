title: 3. Relevance to the initial proposal

LiteMap testing proposal was based on the following assumptions:

*   the community has conversations in multiple (public or half-public) spaces
*   it is difficult to find and follow important information
*   remarkable ideas, initiatives and skills are not being noticed
*   ability to visualise such conversations in attractive presentations might help in decision-making processes
*   ability to visualise information might help in building conversations and preparing events.

The test period was initially planned from January to April 2015, but lasted eventually from February to the beginning of August 2015, while seven maps were created based on data from different online and offline sources related to OuiShare community and conversations happening during the time.

As explained in the communications background chapter, OuiShare adopted three new available tools to manage its daily operations and communications shortly after the proposal was written. The tools (Slack, Loomio and Metamaps) partly covered the needs we had proposed to meet with LiteMap, and especially Slack helped give more internal visibility, inclusivity and focus to the conversations happening in the community. 

As an interesting observation, Metamaps as the only concurrent information mapping tool has not found wide adoption within the community either. It is possible that non-linear descriptive models require a certain type of information analyst profile that OuiShare community currently does not have or attract in numbers, or such people are not visible or active.

Collective building of conversations around OuiShare Fest

We had anticipated using LiteMap in the process of building one of the Fest thematic tracks (decentralization track). However it is difficult to foresee the exact work processes in OuiShare’s very agile work environment. Therefore we ended up working on the track structures in a way where there wasn’t time or possibility to involve a new tool with quite a complicated UX in the process. 

However, a public tweet chat on the impacts of collaborative economy, named after the OuiShare Fest slogan (“Lost in transition?”) was mapped instead with the help of communications team and Storify synthesis. (See Map 3.)
