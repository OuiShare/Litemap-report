OuiShare as a global community operates mainly on two levels: daily with the help of digital tools, and by gathering twice a year for offline Summits where discussions and debates on important matters are held face-to-face. 

Additionally OuiShare local communities work in ways they find best related to the people and cultures involved, which sometimes means more offline activities, as MPRL (Meet People in Real Life) is one of [OuiShare](http://ouishare.net/about/values)’s pronounced values. 

OuiShare’s most active members are called [Connectors](http://ouishare.net/about/team). They are community and project leaders who connect ideas, people and organizations around the collaborative economy.

Until 2014, the only place for common online discussion and sharing crucial information between OuiShare Connectors was a closed Facebook group. This posed several problems, as all Connectors did not have a Facebook account; the social media network could be distracting, and due to information overload it was not certain that everyone would be notified of an important post in due time. 

Day-to-day decisions happened over private e-mail threads or offline conversations. The remaining communication took place in local and thematic Facebook groups, where we started to observe a decrease in interaction, probably due to the same side-effects mentioned above.

By the end of 2014, it was decided to introduce OuiShare Connectors to new communication tools Loomio, Slack and Metamaps in order to make information and day-to-day decisions more easily available and transparent to less involved connectors.

Over the following months, moving to three new digital tools had significant impact on the way the community had conversations and shared information.

Loomio has successfully replaced Facebook group debates and enables making decisions by voting on a proposal emerging from a discussion. 

Slack is used for fast cross-community information sharing and has replaced discussions over e-mail and private chats. Communication streams are represented as channels that any Connector can join. As of August 2015, 66% of Slack posts are direct 1-to-1 messages.

Metamaps is used for mapping any kind of information, relationships, and ideas. Despite personal support and coaching by the Metamaps team, the tool has not found wide adoption yet, most probably because the majority of community members people don’t have time, don’t feel the need for or have difficulties grasping non-linear thinking processes.
